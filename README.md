# 🎤 RemindMe – Voice-Powered Reminder App

RemindMe is a voice-controlled reminder assistant that lets you speak your task and schedule it instantly. Just say `"Remind me that I'll call my mom at 9 PM today"` — and you're done. The app handles the rest: speech recognition, intelligent prompting, and reminder creation.
