All processing is performed locally on your device. We do not transmit your voice recordings, reminders, or any related data to external servers.

## 2. Third-Party Services
The App does not integrate with analytics tools, advertising networks, or third-party tracking services.

All reminder data is stored locally on your device and is removed when you delete the app.
